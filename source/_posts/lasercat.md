## lasercatWorkshop

if you are not familiar with the nodebots, you shoud start by doing the [lasercat workshop][1] that we made with [Tableflip][2] for LXJS 2014

if you cloned the yld-workshop repo, you have the boilerplate code for the lasercat exercise in the exercises folder, fork the repo and start from there.

## What's next ?

it is a bit up to you from here on

- there is a library to play with the bot on npm ```npm i catbot``` details [here][4]
- if you have some electronic component (like a beginer arduino kit) around, you can also do the [nodebot-workshop][3]
- do whatever you what with it
